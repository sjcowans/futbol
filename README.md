Top 3 things that went well during your project:
1) Flexibility - The three of us did a great job of rebounding after a major refactor
2) Communication - We had a near constant stream of communication during work time, consistently discussing changes being made & plans moving forward
3) Collaboration - We also did a great job of teaching and learning from each other, offering insight when another was stuck and working together to push forward.

Top 3 things that your group would do differently next time:
1) Take more time to plan ahead and flesh out an idea of what the project will look like, planning out interactions.
2) Read the directions thoroughly - oversights resulted in, as mentioned before, a massive overhaul early in the project that may have bene avoided if we had paid closer attention to the directions
3)Consistency - Many of our methods wound up being very similarly named, or performing nearly the same function, definitely something we will look for in the future.
